See `github <https://github.com/bjones1/NIST-UAS-3.2>`_ for the source files discussed in this site.


TODO
====
#.  Provide a nice way to rebuild the Pi setup needed to produce an image:

    #.  Create a script to take a Pi from its raw install of the Raspberry PI OS to the proper config for this challenge.

#.  Run multiple iPerf3 instances at boot-up, capturing output from each instance in a uniquely-named log file.

#.  Create a simple webserver to present iPerf3 results as a web page.

#.  Include iOS support. It looks like there are two iPerf3 iOS ports available in the Apple App Store.
